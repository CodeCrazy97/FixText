# FixText
The file [2000error.txt](https://github.com/CodeCrazy97/FixText/blob/master/2000error.txt) contains state-by-state United States election results for the 2000 presidential election. The problem is, every piece of information is on a new line (the state name, votes per candidate, percentage, etc.). This script places all results for each state on one line. The results are placed in the [2000.txt](https://github.com/CodeCrazy97/FixText/blob/master/2000.txt) file. 

For example: In the below picture, the election results in Alabama (popular votes for each candidate, total popular votes, and electoral votes) are on different lines.

After running the Shell script, the results for Alabama will all be on one line, as in the picture below:

The 2000error.txt contains the results on multiple lines. The 2000.txt file contains the fixed election results.
